# Plotly-Challenge

For this challenge, I used Plotly's JavaScript graphing library and the D3 JavaScript library to create a dynamic, interactive dashboard on data from North Carolina State's Belly Button Biodiversity Study . The user has the ability to select specific test subject's ID to view data on each participant. You can view the interactive dashboard here: **https://dunkin-gray.github.io/Plotly-Challenge/index.html**

**data**

• contains my samples.json file of data used in the analysis.

**static / js**

• contains my app.js file used to create each graph and add interactivity to the page.
